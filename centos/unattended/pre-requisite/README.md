# Instruction
As we can not redistribute the Oracle JDK packages, you need download
the the JDK7 and JDK8 RPM packages from [Oracle][1]. And put the files
under this directory.

To save the time to download the Maven and Gradle, you can download [Maven][2]
and [Gradle][3] in advance and put them under the same directory as this
file.
